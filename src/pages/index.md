# Hi, I'm Jared. 👋🏻

I go to [concerts](./concerts), I read [books](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/jaredculp), and sometimes, I [run](https://www.strava.com/athletes/29877893).
I root for the Eagles, Sixers, Phillies, and my alma mater: UVA.


Some of my other esoteric hobbies include:
- Rubik's cubes
- [Chess](https://lichess.org/@/jaredculp)
- Guitar
- Golf
- Meditation


I'm helping make mental healthcare more affordable and accessible [@grow-therapy](https://growtherapy.com) 🌱.
Previously, I was a software engineer [@opower](./opower) 💡, where we used behavioral, data, and computer sciences to drive energy efficiency.
